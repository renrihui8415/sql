**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Upon reflecting on my previous work in data analysis, I recognize the paramount importance of integrating ethics and equity components into the analytical process. While my technical skills in data analysis have allowed me to derive valuable insights and make informed decisions, it's clear that these processes must be aligned with ethical standards and considerations of inequity to ensure responsible and fair outcomes.

Firstly, I would emphasize data privacy and consent, ensuring transparency and strict adherence to legal frameworks. For example, when architecting a cloud-based data center using Amazon Web Services (AWS), I adhered to the principle of 'least privilege' when crafting the schema in the data warehouse, applying security measures by integrating a web application firewall (WAF), employing Identity and Access Control (IAM) to control data access permissions and leveraging Secrets Manager for data encryption.

Secondly, I would tackle inequity by critically assessing datasets for biases and using algorithms designed to mitigate bias. Regular audits would be conducted to identify and correct any discriminatory patterns in the analytical models.

Thirdly, I would evaluate the provider's service structure to ensure alignment with government data policies. While complying with ethics internally, it's crucial to consider if the provider's practices adhere to national regulations. For example, despite claims from major cloud providers of having multiple centers worldwide, many centralize their main computing systems in their headquarter's country. Amazon Web Services (AWS) may be the only cloud provider capable of physically stroing data within a country, whereas others may need redirect data to US centers for analysis, potentially posing compliance challenges. 

In conclusion, by prioritizing data privacy, addressing inequity, and evaluating service structures, I can ensure both technically sound and socially responsible data analyses, benefiting our organization and community.

I viewed science and techonology as supportive tools rather than a complete replacement for human involvement in life and work, with the aim of ensuring ethical integrity and equity especially in the context of data analysis.
